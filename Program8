Experiment 8: Practical Exercise: Set Up a Jenkins CI Pipeline for a Maven
Project, Use Ansible to Deploy Artifacts Generated by Jenkins


git hub repo to use: https://github.com/AppuGokul/Jenkins.git                //Dont use any other repo it might not work! and Branch Specifier option should be */main

#!/bin/bash
set -e

# 1) Build with Maven
mvn clean package

# 2) Deploy via Ansible
ansible-playbook \
  -i /opt/ansible/hosts.ini \
  /opt/ansible/deploy.yml


Post-build Actions:                         // Choose the Archive the artifacts option in the post-build option and paste the given content in files to archive box 

target/*.jar


nano /opt/ansible/deploy.yml             /// Edit this file using nano and paste the below content and delete any other content only this should be there

- name: Deploy HelloMaven JAR
  hosts: local
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Copy built JAR to /opt/deployment
      shell: |
        cp {{ lookup('env','WORKSPACE') }}/target/*.jar /opt/deployment/HelloMaven.jar
      args:
